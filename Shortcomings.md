# Shortcomings of the Current Version of Apache Druid

Apache Druid, while a powerful analytics platform, has several limitations that users should consider when deploying it. These shortcomings include:

## 1. Complex Configuration
- **Challenge**: Druid’s configuration requires substantial manual intervention.
- **Impact**: Initial setup and fine-tuning for optimal performance can be time-consuming.
- **Mitigation**: Follow best practices from the Druid documentation and use community-supported automation scripts.

## 2. Limited Join Capabilities
- **Challenge**: Druid’s support for SQL joins is not as robust as traditional relational databases.
- **Impact**: Complex queries involving multiple datasets may require pre-joined data or additional ETL steps.
- **Mitigation**: Leverage Druid’s lookups for simple key-value joins or preprocess data using tools like Apache Spark.

## 3. Update Costs
- **Challenge**: Updating data, particularly in real-time ingestion scenarios, may require re-ingesting large portions of data.
- **Impact**: High computational and storage costs for datasets that require frequent updates.
- **Mitigation**: Design workflows to minimize updates by pre-aggregating data during ingestion.

## 4. Resource-Intensive Operations
- **Challenge**: Query performance and ingestion throughput depend heavily on available hardware resources.
- **Impact**: Druid’s efficiency decreases significantly without sufficient memory, CPU, or storage.
- **Mitigation**: Use horizontal scaling and allocate resources based on workload requirements.

## 5. Limited Ecosystem Support
- **Challenge**: Druid’s ecosystem is less mature compared to widely-used RDBMS solutions.
- **Impact**: Fewer third-party integrations and community-contributed tools.
- **Mitigation**: Explore available plugins and contribute to the open-source community to enhance the ecosystem.

## 6. Advanced Features Require Expertise
- **Challenge**: Leveraging advanced features, such as custom aggregations or tuning parameters, requires expertise.
- **Impact**: Steeper learning curve for new users.
- **Mitigation**: Invest in training and consult the Apache Druid community for best practices.

## Summary
While Apache Druid excels in real-time analytics, addressing its current limitations often requires additional effort in system design and operation. Users should evaluate these factors alongside their specific use cases to determine whether Druid meets their needs effectively.
